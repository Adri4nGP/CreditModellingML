    "This project will focus on credit modelling, a well-known data science problem that focuses on modeling a borrower's credit risk. We'll be working with financial lending data from Lending Club. Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each borrower completes a comprehensive application, providing their past financial history, the reason for the loan, and more. Lending Club evaluates each borrower's credit score using past historical data and their own data science process to assign an interest rate to the borrower. \n",
    "\n",
    "A higher interest rate means that the borrower is a risk and more unlikely to pay back the loan. While a lower interest rate means that the borrower has a good credit history and is more likely to pay back the loan. The interest rates range from 5.32% all the way to 30.99% and each borrower is given a grade according to the interest rate they were assigned. If the borrower accepts the interest rate, then the loan is listed on the Lending Club marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a loan is fully paid off on time, the investors make a return which corresponds to the interest rate the borrower had to pay in addition to the requested amount. Many loans aren't completely paid off on time and some borrowers default on the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Lending Club has to be extremely savvy and rigorous with their credit modelling, investors on Lending Club need to be equally as savvy about determining which loans are more likely to be paid off. If investors believe the borrower can pay back the loan, even if he or she has a weak financial history, then investors can make more money through the larger additional amount the borrower has to pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most investors use a portfolio strategy to invest small amounts in many loans, with healthy mixes of low, medium, and interest loans. In this project, we'll focus on the mindset of a conservative investor who only wants to invest in the loans that have a good chance of being paid off on time. To do that, we'll need to first understand the features in the dataset and then experiment with building machine learning models that reliably predict if a loan will be paid off or not."
